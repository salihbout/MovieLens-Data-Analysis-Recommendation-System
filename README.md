# MovieLens-Data-Analysis-Recommendation-System

In this project, we analyze MovieLens dataset for movie reviews and build a recommender system.

The notebook file outlines the following sections :

    1. Exploratory data analysis for what we have achieved so far.
        - What is the number of users, movies, and ratings in our platform? How do they grow over time ?
        - How is the ratings distribution ? and how does it look in respect to users age and gender ?
        - A recommender engine to generate more profit

    2. Building the recommender system.
        - How are we supposed to make money out of this ?
        - How can we do it in a large scale ?

### Dependencies
The requirements.txt file lists  all Python libraries that our notebooks depend on, and they will be installed using:
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
